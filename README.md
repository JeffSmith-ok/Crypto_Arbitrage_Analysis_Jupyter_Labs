# Crypto Arbitrage

In this third challenge, I am playing the role of an analyst at a high-tech investment firm. The vice president of my department is considering arbitrage opportunities in the Bitcoin and other cyptocurrencies. Due to the fact that bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, we may be able to capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations through the power of Pandas.

I will sort through historical data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. In this project, I will apply the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunties exist.

The three phases of the financial analysis are:

1. Collect the data.

2. Prepare the data.

3. Analyze the data.
